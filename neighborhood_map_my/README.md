# NJ Transit Train Stations Neighborhood Map Project

Shown is a list of my train stations along my commute.


The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. 
The icons will be re-dropped when clicked and a small window with a wikipedia link about the station will open.

A url from wikipedia is also displayed when a station is clicked.
An AJAX call to wikipedia is made to get a url for the train station.

# How To Use

2. Click on any of the places on the map

# How to Filter
